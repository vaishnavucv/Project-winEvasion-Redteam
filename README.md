# Project-winEvasion-Redteam
#### This Project is build for [Joyel](https://github.com/joyelpbiju) and  [Joshua](https://github.com/JOSHUAPBIJU) Master Applied Computer Science (MACS) students from [Hochschule Schmalkalden - University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hs-schmalkalden.de/en/) Germany 
### Course: Advanced Tactics in Information Security 

> [!NOTE]
> This project integrates the MITRE ATT&CK framework with advanced red team tactics to identify and exploit security vulnerabilities in Windows systems.

> [!TIP]
> Use PowerShell scripts with advanced obfuscation techniques to create Fully Undetectable (FUD) payloads that can bypass Windows Defender.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Regular updates to FUD payloads are necessary to keep up with the latest Windows security features and ensure continued effectiveness.

### Scenario :
_An adversary attempts to send a phishing email to technical support Employees of a XYZ company . One of the employees, who lacks cybersecurity knowledge, opens the email and downloads an attached file. The file is a password-protected ZIP archive. The employee manages to unzip the file and install or test the content within it.
Meanwhile, the adversary gains access to the employee's company laptop. The adversary delivers a PowerShell script disguised as an executable (EXE) file. This script downloads a PowerShell script (PS1) from a cloud server into memory and executes it, bypassing detection by the employee and the default Windows security mechanisms.
The PowerShell script is obfuscated to evade antivirus detection. Once the obfuscated script is running in memory, it gains access to the laptop and spams UAC (User Account Control) prompts to obtain administrative rights. After successfully bypassing UAC, the adversary gains full control over the system._
